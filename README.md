A Hybrid Approach: Combining Permissive and Proprietary Licenses
Given your desire to allow others to use your code initially but eventually commercialize it, a hybrid approach combining a permissive license with proprietary elements might be suitable.

Here's a potential strategy:

Initial Release:

Permissive License: Release your code under a permissive license like MIT or Apache 2.0. This allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code freely.
Community Building: Encourage community involvement and contributions. A thriving community can help you identify bugs, improve your code, and gain valuable feedback.
Transition to Proprietary:

Once your project gains significant traction and you're ready to commercialize it, you can introduce proprietary elements. This could involve:
Adding new features or functionalities that are exclusive to the commercial version.
Restricting certain features or APIs to paid subscribers.
Creating a separate commercial branch of your codebase that incorporates the proprietary elements.
Key Considerations:

Clear Communication: Be transparent with the community about your plans to commercialize the project. This will help manage expectations and avoid misunderstandings.
Fair Transition: Ensure a fair transition from the open-source version to the commercial one. This might involve providing a grace period for existing users to continue using the free version or offering discounted subscription plans.
Legal Advice: Consult with an attorney to understand the legal implications of this approach and to ensure that your licensing strategy complies with relevant laws and regulations.
By combining a permissive license initially with a strategic transition to proprietary elements, you can balance your desire to foster community involvement with your commercial goals.
