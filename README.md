Initial Release:

Permissive License: Release your code under a permissive license like MIT or Apache 2.0. This allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code freely.
Community Building: Encourage community involvement and contributions. A thriving community can help you identify bugs, improve your code, and gain valuable feedback.
Transition to Proprietary:

Once your project gains significant traction and you're ready to commercialize it, you can introduce proprietary elements. This could involve:
- Adding new features or functionalities that are exclusive to the commercial version.
- Restricting certain features or APIs to paid subscribers.
- Creating a separate commercial branch of your codebase that incorporates the proprietary elements.
 
Key Considerations:
- Clear Communication: Be transparent with the community about your plans to commercialize the project. This will help manage expectations and avoid misunderstandings.
- Fair Transition: Ensure a fair transition from the open-source version to the commercial one. This might involve providing a grace period for existing users to continue using the free version or offering discounted subscription plans.
- Legal Advice: Consult with an attorney to understand the legal implications of this approach and to ensure that your licensing strategy complies with relevant laws and regulations.
